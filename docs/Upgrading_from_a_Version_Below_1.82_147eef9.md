## Upgrading from a Version Below 1.82

***

### New jQuery Version Included

With OpenUI5 version 1.82, the third-party library jQuery has been upgraded from Version 2.2.3 to Version 3.5.1. Several measures have been implemented to make this new framework variant of jQuery as compatible as feasible. In particular, the compatibility layer we introduced with this OpenUI5 version means that most of your application or control code may not need adjustment. Nevertheless, **please read the following information carefully** to understand any current and possible future impact.
